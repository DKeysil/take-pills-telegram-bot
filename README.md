This bot is made to remind you about the pills you prescript to take. You can add a new type of medicine with the `/new` command. The bot will ask you the name of the medicine and the time you'd like to receive the reminders.

It will remind you to take a pill until you press the "took it" button every five minutes.

When the treatment is about to end you can make the bot stop to remind you about the pills using the `/pills` command.
